# MSCS532_Assignment5

## Quicksort Implementation and Analysis
This project focuses on understanding the Quicksort algorithm more deeply, to be able to make informed decisions regarding application and implementation of Quicksort algorithm, its performance analysis, and emperical analysis and comparison with Randomized Quicksort. 

## Files
- 'Assignment 5.pdf' : Report detailing design choices, implementation details, and analysis.
- 'Emperical Analysis.py' : Python code to draw comparison and graph between deterministic and randomized quicksorts.
- 'MSCS532_Assignment5.py' : Python implementation of both the deterministic and randomized Quicksort algorithms.
## How to Run
1. Clone the repository using the command: https://github.com/prashcodes10/MSCS532_Assignment5
2. Make sure python is already installed in the system. 
3. Run the code using the command: python.\MSCS532_Assignment5.py OR python.\Emperical Analysis.py

## Summary
This project highlights the implementation, performance analysis, and the impact of randomization on Quicksort.
